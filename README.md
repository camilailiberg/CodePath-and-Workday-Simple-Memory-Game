2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission 
(be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

- A challenge that I encountered in creating this submission was that the game didn't finish when the player won. 
I overcame it by checking my code with the version of the guess function provided by CodePath and realize that I was 
checking if progress was equal to 8 instead of 7. This is because I had forgotten that progress started at 0 instead of 1, 
so I was checking if progress was equal to 8 (the length of the pattern) but because progress started at 0 I had to check if 
progress was equal to 7, not 8. After fixing that my code worked correctly and I didn't face any other challenges.


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? 
(recommended 100 - 300 words) 

- After completing my submission, a question that I have is, how when someone types a website's name on the URL the right page loads?
What I mean by this is, how does the right page load with all of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript corresponding to it? 
Because I typed the URL that glitch provides on a new tab on google chrome and it opened the game, which means I can share the 
URL with a friend and they will be able to play it too, which is awesome! But I just wonder how the code that I wrote is out there.
- I also know that some web sites look weird on phones or tablets sometimes and that some websites 
are specifically made for phone mode or tablet mode. I wonder where is the difference between a web site made 
for a normal computer view vs phone or tablet. Because before I would have thought that it had to do with 
the size of the screen and the way elements are positioned, but I remember reading in this tutorial that "Most 
HTML elements on a web page are part of a "flow" layout, and web browsers will adjust the way they are positioned 
on the screen based on the size of the browser window (and the zoom level)" therefore a question I have after 
completing my submission is, where is the difference when creating a website for computer view vs phone/tablet view
or also vs a website that works well for all the types of screen sizes?


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (
for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). 
Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

- I would try to make the User Interface look better. By this, I mean making the start and end buttons nicer. I would also try to change the way the user is notified that s/he won or lost by showing them a different web page.
- If I had more time I would spend time creating a function that creates a random pattern every time a new game starts. I know this may not sound right for this game since the idea is that the player memorizes the pattern, but the reason I would do it is to test the player's memory to another level because they wouldn't have that "extra time" to memorize the patter after losing a few times, instead, they would have to really concentrate and pay attention each time they play because the pattern would be different each time.
- I would probably also try to add more buttons as the player wins.
What I mean by this is, every time the player completes a pattern, I would ask the player if they want to keep playing. If they do, I would add a new button and generate a new pattern but I would keep the pattern's length untouched. And, after they complete that pattern, I would ask if they want to keep playing, and if they do, I would keep adding more buttons and generating new patterns as long as the player wants to keep playing. Basically, it would be like moving one level up, as long as the player wants to keep playing and, obviously, as long as they get the patter right.
- After having the previous feature working, I would spend time trying to make the patter's length one more than what it was before as the player goes from one level to the next. So every time a new button is added, the pattern's length would increase by 1.
- I would also spend time trying to make the pattern play faster as the player moves through the pattern, just to make it a little bit harder to memorize the pattern.
